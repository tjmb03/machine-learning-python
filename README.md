# Machine Learning Toolkit (Python)

A structured collection of core machine learning algorithms implemented and explored in Python.

This repository is organized as modular subfolders covering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, ensemble methods, and dimensionality reduction.

Designed as a foundational ML toolkit rather than isolated notebooks.
